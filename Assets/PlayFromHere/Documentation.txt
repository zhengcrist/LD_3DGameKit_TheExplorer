1-This tool is simple just have a object in your scene with the tag Player.

2-Then Shift+Right Click on a object and select Play From here.

If you dont want to use tags add the component PFH_Player to your player.

To configure the plugin click on the window Play From Here >> Config, or go to the folder PlayFromHere>Resources>Config>PFH_Config.asset 

Explaining the configs:

-Offset: If you character needs a offset for example 1 unit on Z.
-Rotate Player With View: If you want your player to rotate based on the scene view. If you disable the player will keep the rotation.
-Keep X,Y,Z: Keep the current player position on the desired axis.
